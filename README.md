# GuessNumberRemake
Guess Number game. It's a remake of my old one that was made when I just started to learn JS.


Some info about old one: I created it when I was just starting JavaScript course,
 I just coppied script code that I wrote witch course and with very minimal knowledge of HTML & CSS
tried to create my own designed version. Link to the old version: https://github.com/Jasiuka/GuessNumberInLT


Now I wanted to remake this game, because I have more knowledge of HTML & CSS and also with JavaScript.
This time I used JavaScript classes for code architecture, with private fields, incapsulated functions, etc.
Also using local storage added possibility to save highscores.
- Responsive design 
- Language change (EN - LT)
- Highscore saving
